    <h1><strong>Hello!</strong></h1>
        <p><br>So there actually isn't anything here yet due to the fact that this is a side project of mine and I'm currently busy with school.
            <br>If for any reason you want to help me out with my website, feel free to do so either by opening a pull request in my repo or by messaging me on discord.
            <br>My discord is: Hobospider132#4056</p>      
        <p>Link to the website repo is here:</p><a href="https://github.com/Hobospider132/Hobospider132.github.io">Website repo</a>
