                This version has been discontinued.

            <p>
                So there actually isn't anything here yet due to the fact that this is a side project of mine and I'm currently busy with school.
                    <br>If for any reason you want to help me out with my website, feel free to do so either by opening a pull request in my repo or by <br>messaging me on discord.
                    My discord is: Hobospider132#4056.<br>One final note, currently I have a very basic knowledge of HTML and other webdev components, however, I am currently taking courses.<br>Hopefully by December this will be a good website

                So I didn't actually need a website but I learnt about github pages and it seems very cool

            <div class="header">Osu! skin</div>
            <p>
                    I made an Osu! skin with things that I liked from other skins. <br>I used components from AutumnVN's Mahiru skin, Bacon Boi skin, White cat, Hidden optimised, Pzzy's cursor dance and Selyu's cursor dance
